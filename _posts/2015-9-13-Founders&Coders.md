title: Starting Founders & Coders  (whoop whoop)!
---

As I write this blog post, I am both excited and nervous, I am due to start a full time, full stack javascript course with Founders & Coders in London. Everyone who has learnt to code will know, this will be both an addictive and painful process. I feel incredibly luck to be spending the next four months working in teams, learning stuff, and hopefully building some awesome products.

What is Founders & Coders? It’s a new intuitive, so you haven’t heard of it before thats ok. Based in East London (Bethnal Green) they run regular courses and meetups, all with the aim of teaching more people to code. The full time course that I will be doing focuses on learning JavaScript full stake (i.e. front end and back end). Similar to the General Assembly & Makers Academy, but with one  crucial difference, its all free, so like  I said, I feel very lucky to have a place.

Now  I am not a complete newby to code, last year I took a course with the excellent Startup Institute , where I learnt HTML, CSS and UX , and really caught the bug for all things tech and startup. After that I went on to work in PM/UX role for an early stage startup, which left me want to get even more techy. My hope is that after F&C I should be able to get a junior front end job, ideally in small company where I can still use my design skills.

Prior to my F&C application, I knew very little JavaScript, but meeting the course requirements is actually quite rigours, so I already it feels like I have learnt alot. I found out about the programme by attending one of F&C regular monday meetup, ( Coding for Everyone , check it out!). Now to get a place on to the course, you have to work up a number of levels on a fiendishly tricky website Codewars , and go through the awkward and embrassing process of creating your own application video, if you want to cringe you can see mine here. 
As I finish this blog post on the morning before the course starts, I can say I am truly excited to start on my path of JavaScript learning.
